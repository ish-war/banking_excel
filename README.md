# Banking- Dynamic Risk Profiling
banking- Dynamic Risk Profiling and Performance Analysis in Consumer Lending

### Industry Context

The consumer lending sector is a critical component of the financial services industry, providing individuals with access to credit for various purposes such as buying a car, financing education, consolidating debt, or improving homes.

Effective management of loan portfolios is essential for financial institutions to mitigate risks, enhance profitability, and ensure customer satisfaction.

With the increasing complexity of consumer lending, advanced data analysis techniques are vital for understanding borrower behavior, assessing loan risk profiles, and making informed strategic decisions.

### Objective
* The objective of this case study was to apply advanced data analysis techniques using Excel to gain a deep understanding and effectively manage a loan portfolio.
* This involved assessing loan risk profiles, evaluating financial performance metrics, gaining insights into borrower behaviors, and ultimately developing a comprehensive, interactive Excel dashboard.
* These efforts aimed to provide strategic recommendations for optimizing loan portfolio management, mitigating risks, and enhancing decision-making processes for financial institutions and stakeholders in the consumer lending sector.

### About the Data
The dataset used for this project contained detailed information about individual loans, including:

* Unique identifiers for loans
* Issue dates and final dates of loans
* Employment lengths and home ownership statuses of borrowers
* Income categories and annual incomes of borrowers
* Loan amounts and terms
* Application types and purposes
* Interest payments, loan conditions, and interest rates
* Grades, debt-to-income ratios, total payments, total principals received, recoveries, installments, and regions.

### Data Preprocessing
Several preprocessing steps were taken to ensure data quality and consistency:

* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
* Normalization: Standardizing data formats for consistency.
* Calculated Columns and Measures: Creating calculated columns and measures for key metrics such as total loan applications, total loan amounts, total payments received, average interest rates, and average debt-to-income (DTI) ratios.
* Filtering and Aggregation: Filtering data for specific analyses and aggregating values to obtain total amounts, payments, and percentages for various categories.
